    "Hi claude how's it going.. so as you can see i have completed the phase 1 (most of it) we do not have a ping pong tool rather we have a calculator tool and that is perfectly fine. now we are in a new repo folder name, different from the old one. but i've ported over all ourr history and files of planning so that we can the right context on what this is and what we are going to do with it. pleae explore and catch up. then report back to me. important you mak sure that archon knows this is the repo for the PRP and not the old path addresss.
